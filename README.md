Killer7 inspired custom stuff i made for tf2
designed for tf_use_min_viewmodels 1 and viewmodel_fov around 70

Sounds are sv_pure "compatible" ( they'll still be replaced by the default sounds, but they wont make screeching sounds ) by matching the rate and filesize

k7class_spy:
  - coyote smith animations for spy's revolvers
  - sound replacements for stock and ambassador

k7sounds_hitsounds:
  - heaven smile flinch noise for hits
  - random heaven smile laugh for kills
  - replaces game_sounds_weapons and mvm_level_sounds txt files
  - adds the crit bomb sound onto critical hits you inflict
  
k7sounds_misc:
  - freezecam zoom in sound
  - voice lines for the domination/revenge UI sounds
